## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- Understanding how to manipulate the DOM effectively using JavaScript was challenging at first, especially when dynamically creating and updating elements based on filtered data. 

- Getting the BACK TO TOP button to appear only when the user reached the bottom of the page involved learning how to use the scroll event and manage visibility through JavaScript.
